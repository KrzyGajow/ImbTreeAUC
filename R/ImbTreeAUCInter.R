#' Fit an Interactive Decision Tree
#'
#' @param Y_name Name of the target variable. Character vector of one element.
#' @param X_names Attribute names used for target (Y_name) modelling. Character vector of many elements.
#' @param data Data.frame in which to interpret the parameters Yname and Xnames.
#' @param depth Set the maximum depth of any node of the final tree, with the root node counted as depth 0. 
#' Numeric vector of one element which is greater or equal to 0.
#' @param min_obs The minimum number of observations that must exist in any terminal node (leaf). 
#' Numeric vector of one element which is greater or equal to 1.
#' @param type Method used for learning. Character vector of one element with one of the: "Shannon", "Renyi", "Tsallis", "Sharma-Mittal", ""Sharma-Taneja", "Kapur".
#' @param levelPositive: Name of the positive class (label) used in AUC calculation, i.e. predictions being the probability of the positive event; character vector of one element.
#' @param cp Complexity parameter, i.e. any split that does not decrease the overall lack of fit by a factor of cp is not attempted. 
#' It refers to miss-classification error. If cost or weights are specified aforementioned measure takes these parameter into account.
#' Numeric vector of one element which is greater or equal to 0.
#' @param n_cores Number of cores used for parallel processing. Numeric vector of one element which is greater or equal to 1.
#' @param weights Numeric vector of cases weights. It should have as many elements as the number of observation in the data.frame passed to the data parameter.
#' @param cost Matrix of costs associated with the possible errors. The matrix should have k columns and rows, where k is the number of class levels. 
#' Rows contain true classes while columns contain predicted classes. Rows and columns names should take all possible categories (labels) of the target variable.
#' @param AUCweight: Method used for AUC weighting in multiclass classification problems; character vector of one element with one of the: "none", "bySize", "byCost".
#' @param class_th Method used for determining thresholds based on which the final class for each node is derived. 
#' If cost is specified it can take one of the following: "theoretical", "tuned", otherwise it takes "equal". 
#' Character vector of one element.
#' @param overfit Character vector of one element with one of the: "none",”leafcut”, "prune", "avoid" specifying which method overcoming overfitting should be used. 
#' ”leafcut” method is used when the full tree is built, it reduces the subtree when both siblings choose the same class label.
#' "avoid" method is incorporated during the recursive partitioning, it prohibit the split when both sibling chose the same class.
#' “prune” method employs pessimistic error pruning procedure, it should be specified along with the cf parameter.
#' @param cf Numeric vector of one element with the number in (0, 1) for the optional pessimistic-error-rate-based pruning step.
#' @param amb_prob Ambiguity threshold for the difference between the highest class probability and the second highest class probability per node, 
#' below which the expert has to make a decision regarding the future tree structure. Logical vector with one element.
#' It works when the amb_class parameter is NULL.
#' @param top_split Number of best splits, i.e. final trees structure to be presented. Splits are sorted in descending order according to the information gain. 
#' Numeric vector with one element.
#' @param var_lev Decision indicating whether possible best splits are derived on the attribute level (higher) or on the split point for each attribute (lower).
#' “TRUE” means that the expert gets the best splits, one for each variable. 
#' "FALSE” means the best splits at all where it might happen that the expert receives top_split splits coming from only one variable.
#' Logical vector with one element.
#' @param amb_class Labels of class for which the expert will make a decision during the learning.
#' Character vector of many elements (from 1 up to number of classes). Should have the same number of elements as vector passed to the amb_class_freq parameter.
#' @param amb_class_freq Classes frequencies per node above which the expert will make a decision. 
#' Numeric vector of many elements (from 1 up to number of classes). Should have the same number of elements as vector passed to the amb_class parameter.
#' @param tree_path Path to the folder where the proposed trees created during the interactive learning will be stored. 
#' *.txt file with the tree structure is iteratively updated. Character vector with one element.
